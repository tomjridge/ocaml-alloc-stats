Notes on the provenance of some of the files:

* irmin-mem: 
  - irmin-mem.ctf: generated by using memtrace/statmemprof when running irmin in-mem
    tests, with MEMTRACE_TRACE=0.001
  - irmin-mem.ctf.dump: generated by dump.exe in ocaml-gc-events-tracing; this is an
    easy-to-read format for the ctf, such that the data can be easily munged using
    Python. Python also includes support for reading ctf files directly
